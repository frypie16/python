    "As we mentioned earlier, one of the most popular forms of python dictionaries you'll run across as you work is __JSON__ ([JavaScript Object Notation](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)). JSON is the primary format in which data is passed back and forth to APIs ([Application Programming Interface](https://medium.com/@perrysetgo/what-exactly-is-an-api-69f36968a41f)), and most API servers will send their responses in JSON format. Python has great JSON support, with the json package. We won't learn about calling APIs today (*stay tuned for week 6!*) but to get started, we'll play around with a snippet of a call result from the New York Times API."
